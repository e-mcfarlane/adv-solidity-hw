## Methodology:

1. Complete code and compile:
Successful compile of KaseiCoin file
![compile contract](compiledCoin.jpg)

Successful compile of KaseiCoinCrowdsale file
![compile contract](compileCrowdsale.jpg)

2. Deploy Crowdsale contract & KaseiCoin contract
![deploy contract](https://github.com/e-mcfarlane/adv-solidity-hw/blob/bbbbd8357b2874025636494b364c0177af2d732b/deployed%20coin.jpg)

3. Mint from two different accounts
Mint 7 KC from 1st wallet
![7 KC minted to 1st wallet](https://github.com/e-mcfarlane/adv-solidity-hw/blob/bbbbd8357b2874025636494b364c0177af2d732b/1st%20transaction.jpg)

## Withdraw Account 2
![9 KC minted to 2nd wallet](https://github.com/e-mcfarlane/adv-solidity-hw/blob/0f9546da6d79127a91a89740fa8b409f65ccec10/2nd%20transaction%20and%20total%20weiRaised.jpg)

Notice at the bottom left total weiRaised is 16000000000000000000wei the correct combination of the 7000000000000000000wei (1st wallet) and 9000000000000000000wei from the second wallet.  Also notice in the first wallet (where I deployed the contract) 9"ETH"(DEGEN) was deposited from the 2nd wallet transaction.
